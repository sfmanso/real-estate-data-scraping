## How to use code

Simply change the number in the parenthesis in the last line of the file [main.py](https://github.com/sfmanso/real-estate-data-scraping/blob/main/main.py) to the number of web pages you want to scrape.
```python
run(10)

## Future Works

I plan to release a part 2 version of this code, that will be more of a data analysis of the data generated from this file.
